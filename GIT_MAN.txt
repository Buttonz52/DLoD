GIT MANUAL OF OPERATOIN
-----------------------
This is what I think the git procedure should be.

INITIALIZE
----------
-Create new git repo: git init
-Add remote repo: git remote add origin <<URL>>

BRANCHES
--------
Make new branch: git checkout -b <<new branch name>>
Show all available branches: git branch
Move to different branch: git checkout <<branch name>>

PULL
----
If your branch is behind the master branch, pull before working on new content.

Pull: git pull origin master



PUSH
----
Push only to your own branch. NEVER TO MASTER.

Add: git add -A
Commit: git commit -m "Unique message here"
Push: git push origin <<Your Branch>>

MERGING WITH MASTER
-------------------
First move to the master branch: git checkout master
Check if it is up-to-date by trying to do a pull.

Merge: git merge <<Your Branch>>

If two people do not change the same lines of code in a given file there will be no merge conflicts.

else merge conflicts arise:

If the merging window appears type ":q" to get out of it.
If it looks like there are merging conflicts, note which file they are in.
CTRL + F in the file for "<<" this will show you the merge conflict spots.
Then manually choose the most up-to-date version of the code.
